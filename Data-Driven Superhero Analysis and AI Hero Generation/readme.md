Superheroes
===

# Background

### Giving credit
JSON data for superheroes and their powers based on [Claudio Davi's Kaggle dataset](https://
www.kaggle.com/datasets/claudiodavi/superhero-set/). My contribution was converting their CSV files to JSON.

### To run Ruby
* Install ruby on your laptop
* Make sure you are in the `heroes` directory with all of this code â€” VS Code usually does this for you
* Type `ruby superheroes.rb` from the command line, similar to how we did for C#
* If Ruby doesn't work, let us know and we will help you fix it!

### Sample functions provided
* Count how many superheroes have the power of AcceleratedHealing (should be 174)
* Count how many superheroes have no powers (should be 72)

# Your assignment

### Part A: My questions for you to answer
1. What are the most popular and least popular superpowers for superheroes with at least 1 superpower?
1. What is the average number of superpowers per superhero?
1. What is the average number of superpowers for superheroes with at least 1 superpower?
    * remove superheroes with zero superpowers
1. What are the most popular and least popular superpowers by publisher?
    * this helps us know things like whether super strength is more popular with DC Comics than with Marvel
1. What is the breakdown by gender of the superheroes?

### Part B: Your questions for you to answer
1. Come up with 2 additional questions to ask of this data, and answer them using Ruby code
    * explain each question

### Part C: Generating new superheroes with AI
* Using an AI Service such as ChatGPT or POE, generate new superheroes in the same JSON format
    * Tell the AI that you will give it JSON data about superheroes and that you want new superheroes in that format
    * Give the AI the JSON format as a prompt; it should acknowledge that is has received it
    * Then ask for 20 new superheroes!
    * Analyze these superheroes, refine your prompt with feedback or further instruction, and generate new superheroes
        * This is common when generating data! You usually must give the AI additional feedback or instruction to get better data
* Once you are happy with your new superheroes, use your ability to read the JSON file, plus Ruby code from Part 1 and 2, and possibly some new Ruby code, to analyze these new superheroes
    * What was the "best" superhero generated, and why?
    * What was the "worst" superhero generated, and why?
    * What did you have to do with your prompts to get better superheroes?
    * Be sure to submit a link to your AI transcript!

# What to submit
A Google Doc uploaded to Classroom
* For Part A, include the question, the code formatted so that it looks like code, and the answers
* For Part B, include your question, the code formatted so that it looks like code, the answers, and your analysis of the answers
* For Part C, include the link to your AI transcript, your analysis of the superheroes, and your experiences improving your prompts
